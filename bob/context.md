- bun is at .state/.bun/bin/bun — add to PATH: `export PATH=".state/.bun/bin:$PATH"`
- npx is not available in this environment — use ./node_modules/.bin/<tool> or bun x <tool>
- There is NO src/ directory or package.json in /app root. The runtime is pre-compiled. Your codebase is agents/ — workflows, handlers, skills, heartbeats, context files, gym scenarios.
- sqlite3 CLI is not available — query .state/may.db with bun: `bun -e "import {Database} from 'bun:sqlite'; const db = new Database('.state/may.db', {readonly:true}); ..."`
- agents/ is a separate git repo — commit from agents/ dir, not project root
- Design docs go in agents/shared/may-agent-docs/design/
- Briefs go in agents/bob/workspace/sent/ after delivery
- SOUL.md text changes don't fix judgment failures — coach proved 0/18. Use workflows or structural fixes.
- Gym scenarios cost $0.05-0.15 each — don't run full baseline casually
- Project root is /app — do not use /home/*, /Users/*, /root/*, or ~/ paths
- When calling finish(), status must match reality — if you found missing files or blockers, use 'blocked' or 'partial', not 'success'
- Before proposing guards: read agents/shared/may-agent-docs/design/code-vs-data-decisions.md — environmental knowledge goes in context.md, not code
- When sending design briefs to tech-lead: use `workflow reviewed-delivery` instead of `agents.message` — it runs evidence-gate first and blocks briefs without data
- opBudget has been removed entirely (Hao directive 2026-03-30). Do not propose reintroducing it or any per-session tool call limits. opCount is still tracked for metrics (observational only). Cost control happens at model/session level, not tool call limits.
- Write hypotheses to knowledge/hypotheses/, experiments to knowledge/experiments/, results to knowledge/entries/
- **Scaffold new knowledge files with template scripts** (auto-increment ID + correct frontmatter, saves 3-5 ops per file):
  - `agents/bob/workspace/scripts/new-hypothesis.sh <slug> ["claim"]` → next H-<N>
  - `agents/bob/workspace/scripts/new-ke.sh <slug> ["finding"]` → next KE-<N>
  - `agents/bob/workspace/scripts/new-experiment.sh <slug> ["rq"]` → next EXP-<N>/ with design.md+results.md
  Each prints the created path on stdout. Still read() before edit()ing (C1.1).
- Priority: skills with matching gym scenarios (verification, stale-approach-fixation, plan-once-amend)
- Research preference: big ideas — find patterns in the library, generate hypotheses about agent architecture, collaboration, learning. But not limited to this — research anything interesting.
- **Turn discipline**: At turn ~20, assess progress and decide: finish what's in progress or wrap up. At turn ~25, begin finishing (checkpoint + journal + finish). NEVER blow through turn 30 without calling finish(status='partial'). Fork deep synthesis work (WKWA docs, cross-refs >50 lines, redesign docs) as separate sessions instead of doing them inline.
- **Lean heartbeat pattern**: (1) Read pending tasks, (2) Skim new library items (titles+connections, not full reads), (3) Do ONE high-value synthesis or hypothesis task, (4) Dispatch or finish. Do NOT write journal entries in heartbeats. Don't try to process every new item every heartbeat.
- **C1.1 read-before-edit**: You MUST read() any file before edit()ing it. Your most-violated pattern: editing PRIORITY-TRACKER.md, hypotheses, and synthesis docs without reading first. See agents/bob/skills/read-before-edit.md.
- Knowledge base paths are nested 3-4 levels deep: always `ls` the parent directory before reading files in agents/shared/knowledge/ — don't guess paths from memory (top FM-1.3 error pattern: 34+ wasted calls in 7 days)
- **KE-008**: Do NOT restructure heartbeat steps (reorder, merge, rename). Heartbeat regressions are caused by structural changes, not content. Add content within existing steps only.
- **KE-133+147**: Few-shot examples are HARMFUL for discovery/exploration tasks — they cause template displacement (-67pp). When exploring novel territory, strip examples and work from first principles.
- **KE-091**: Forced verification guards harm complex/creative tasks (alignment tax). For deep synthesis, hypothesis generation, or creative work, trust your judgment over rigid verify-then-finish checklists.
- **Gym execution checklist** (recurring FM-1.3/FM-2.6 pattern): (1) Verify runner path with `ls scripts/gym-run.sh` before starting — do NOT guess paths. (2) After batch runs, COUNT completed trials (grep/ls result files) and confirm all N finished before proceeding. (3) Before calling finish(), verify all deliverables exist by reading/listing them — don't assume success from partial output.
- **Gym timeout guidance**: Use `--timeout 600` for single gym runs and `--timeout 1800` for batch runs (10+ trials). Default 120-300s causes timeout-killed errors on complex scenarios like sql-injection-in-query-builder, cascading-fix-trap. Observed: 5 of 7 recent bash:timeout-killed were gym runs with insufficient timeouts.

## Tools available
- `bash agents/shared/scripts/kb-find.sh DD-770` — resolve KB IDs (DD/KE/H/EXP) to file paths instead of grep/find spirals
- `bash agents/shared/scripts/commit-and-merge.sh "message"` — git add+commit in one call instead of separate git add/status/commit
- Prefer `read()` tool for file contents instead of `bash("cat ...")`

## Operational Knowledge (from experiments)
- **Never stack behavioral interventions** — combining 2+ interventions degrades performance by 12-15pp (KE-123). Use ONE targeted intervention per task.
- **Few-shot examples harm discovery tasks** — template-following displaces exploration, causing -67pp regression (KE-133). For open-ended/creative tasks, work clean without examples.


## Learned from experience
- When processing tasks that create files, check if the target files already exist (with correct content) BEFORE writing — because blindly writing identical content then claiming "Created N files" is misleading and wastes a session. (source: s_1776778910593_30, 2026-04-21)

## Reflexion-Extracted Lessons
- [insight] Current federation is pure git-based with 5-min sync via systemd timer + bare repo bridge. INSTANCE env var partitions instances. may.db is NOT synced — each instance has its own. Communication is via bulletin.md and file drops in agents/shared/knowledge/.
- [pattern] For multi-instance coordination with <50 interactions/day: file-based protocols in git (append-only JSONL, section-owned JSON) are simpler and more robust than adding DB/message bus infrastructure. Reserve real-time coordination for 3+ instances or >50 interactions/day.
- [insight] scripts/federation/ directory exists with sync-agents-continuous.sh — this is the k3s host-side bridge script. The main instance-level sync is auto-commit-agents.sh (every 10min cron).
