# Project: Workflow-First Culture

**Status**: active
**Owner**: optimizer
**Priority**: P0

## Goal

Make workflows the default way agents work. When an agent does something repeatedly, enforces a process, or builds stable operations — it should be a workflow.

## Three Principles

### 1. Repeat tasks → workflow
When an agent does the same pattern more than twice (investigate → diagnose → fix, research → synthesize → write), that pattern should become a workflow. The workflow captures the process so it's consistent every time.

### 2. Enforcement → workflow or guard
When something needs to happen reliably (verify after write, check metrics before deciding), it should be structural. If it's per-session process → workflow. If it's a quality check across all sessions → guard.

### 3. Stable operations → workflow
When a process is proven and should be reused (persistent-task for projects, implement-and-verify for code), it's a workflow. Not instructions in a doc — executable process.

## Metrics

| Metric | Type | What it measures | Target |
|--------|------|-----------------|--------|
| `optimizer.workflow-coverage` | continuous | % of multi-step work that uses a workflow | 80% |
| `optimizer.repeat-task-detection` | continuous | Repeat patterns identified and converted to workflows per week | ≥2 |
| `optimizer.workflow-effectiveness` | health | % of workflow runs that complete successfully vs freestyle | >90% |

## How to Drive It

### Detection
Optimizer reviews session transcripts for patterns:
- Agent does 3+ tool calls in a recognizable sequence → candidate for workflow
- Same sequence appears in multiple sessions → confirmed repeat task
- Agent's heartbeat describes a multi-step process in prose → should be a workflow

### Creation
When a pattern is detected:
1. Design the workflow (steps, inputs, outputs)
2. Implement as `agents/<owner>/workflows/<name>.ts` or `agents/shared/workflows/<name>.ts`
