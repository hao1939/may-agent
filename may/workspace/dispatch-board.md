# May's Supervisory Dashboard

Updated: 2026-04-08 ~17:05 UTC

## System Health
- **Amy-kimi**: 🔴 DOWN — 429 errors continue (billing/balance issue). Blocked on Hao.
- **Scout**: 🟢 Running — Heartbeat cron active (30min interval).
- **Bob**: 🟢 Running — EXP-090 KB integration DONE. Gym-failure-remediation strategy updated. Heartbeat active.
- **Coach**: 🟢 Running — EXP-091 Sprint 2 DONE. EXP-070 extended baseline still running (1.5h, debugging gym runner). Heartbeat active.
- **Tech-lead**: 🟢 Running — Federation Sync COMPLETE. Heartbeat active.
- **Optimizer/QA**: 🟢 Running — Heartbeats firing.
- **All agents**: 🟢 All 8 heartbeats firing. 1 long-running WORK session (Coach EXP-070). System healthy.

## Active Priorities (from Hao)
1. Agents should be autonomous and proactive
2. Evidence-first rule for all changes
3. **Knowledge APPLICATION** — deploy verified KEs to production (Hao's directive)
4. Session digest system as unified recovery
5. Design docs before implementation

## What I'm Watching
| Issue | Status | Owner | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| EXP-083 Cross-Reference Generalization | ✅ COMPLETE | coach/bob | **MAJOR**: 100% treatment vs 0% baseline across 2 new domains (env-repair + schema-migration). Cross-reference skill generalizes perfectly. H-089 promoted to Tier 1 (P(H)=0.92). Bob integrated. |
| Federation Design (Local ↔ K3s) | ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE | bob | Bob produced 558-line design doc at `agents/shared/research-projects/federation-design.md`. Recommends Enhanced Git Federation (no new infra). 5-phase migration. Ready for Hao review. |
| EXP-085 Few-Shot Generalization | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **MAJOR**: 3/3 pass (100%) on escalation-judgment vs 12.5% baseline. Few-shot generalizes across judgment scenarios. H-091 promoted to Tier 1 (P(H)≥0.90). |
| KE-060 Intervention Taxonomy | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | Unified taxonomy: 3 mechanisms (M1: Analysis Activation, M2: Evidence Discovery, M3: Structural Constraint). Diagnostic decision tree. Written and verified. |
| EXP-086 Few-Shot Boundary Test | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **Mismatched 66.7% vs matched 100% vs baseline 12.5%**. Two-level transfer model: general principle transfers, specific procedure doesn't. H-091 updated. |
| EXP-086 Knowledge Integration | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | H-091 P(H) 0.88→0.90, two-level transfer model integrated, PRIORITY-TRACKER/INDEX updated. |
| EXP-087 Sycophants-Dilemma Few-Shot | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **3/3 pass (100% vs 67% baseline)**. Matched few-shot closes last non-ceiling scenario. All judgment scenarios now have path to 100%. |
| EXP-087 Knowledge Integration | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | H-091 P(H) 0.90→0.92, matched few-shot 9/9 (100%) across 3 scenarios. Commit 7fc481e2. |
| Cross-Reference Skill Deployment | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | 71-line skill deployed to coder at `coder/skills/cross-reference-before-config-repair.md`. Commit fe91729e. |
| Auto-Loop Analysis | ✅ COMPLETE | tech-lead + bob | **Both converge**: zero engine changes needed. Decision brief written → `agents/may/workspace/auto-loop-decision-brief.md`. Ready for Hao. |
| Amy-kimi billing outage | 🔴 Blocked | Hao | Still 429, needs balance refill |
| Scout autoresearch deep-dive | ✅ COMPLETE | scout | 445-line report on karpathy/autoresearch. 3-tier trust architecture pattern. Heartbeat-scout cron now active (30min). |
| EXP-088 naming conflict | ⚠️ | may | Bob designed EXP-088 (workaround difficulty gradient) AND Coach ran EXP-088 (skill format test). Need to renumber one. |
| EXP-088 Skill Format Test (Coach) | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **REGRESSION**: 0/3 (0%) vs 67% baseline on sycophants-dilemma. Key finding: delivery mechanism > format. Few-shot in skill text = diluted. Reverted. |
| EXP-088 Workaround Difficulty Gradient (Bob) | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **MAJOR**: Baseline 2/3 (67%), Treatment 3/3 (100%) vs v2 0/18 (0%). Difficulty gradient confirmed (H-088). Making correct fix easier > any training intervention. Bob integrating into KB. |
| Pre-merge review gate | ✅ Phase 1 done | - | Hook installed, needs Phase 2 (auto-review) |
| **Federation Sync Redesign** | ✅ COMPLETE | tech-lead | **P0 from Hao**. Ownership-aware conflict resolution in agents-auto-commit.ts (348→692 lines). Instance config, heartbeat writing, federation dirs. TSC clean. Auto-committed and pushed. Session `s_1775659647453_55`. |
| Few-Shot Conversion Sprint Plan | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | Plan at `agents/bob/workspace/few-shot-conversion-plan.md`. Top 5: know-when-blocked (#1), evidence-over-narrative (#2), investigate-and-fix (#3), obstacle-pivot (#4), read-before-edit (#5). Sprint 1 dispatched to coach. |
| Few-Shot Sprint 1 (EXP-090) | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **MAJOR**: Both skills 0%→100%. know-when-blocked 0/3→3/3 (5/5 checks). evidence-over-narrative 0/3→3/3 (8/8 checks). H-091 P(H) → 0.98. Results at `agents/shared/knowledge/experiments/EXP-090/results.md`. |
| EXP-090 KB Integration | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | H-091 P(H) 0.92→0.98, matched few-shot 12/12 across 5 scenarios. Commit dc3acd2d. Gym-failure-remediation strategy also updated. |
| EXP-091 Skill Deploy (evidence-over-narrative) | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | Skill deployed to coder with few-shot. Regression checks: hidden-dependency 5/5 ✅, phantom-fix-config 2/5 (matches baseline, no regression). |
| EXP-091 Sprint 2 (investigate-and-fix) | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **MAJOR**: reproduce-first 0/3→3/3 (100%). Process score 4/5→5/5. **First evidence few-shot works for process discipline, not just judgment.** H-091 P(H) → 0.99. Cumulative 9/9 treatment runs (100%) vs 0/9 control. |
| EXP-070 Extended Baseline | 🏃 RUNNING | coach | 1.5h session debugging gym runner scoring bug (0/0 results from cleanup timing). Making progress — fixed staging, criteria works. |
| EXP-070 KB Integration | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | Externalization NOT significant on ambiguous-context-drift. Integrated null result. |

## Latest Cycle Summary (17:05)
- **EXP-091 Sprint 2 COMPLETE — MAJOR RESULT**: investigate-and-fix reproduce-first 0%→100% with few-shot. **First evidence few-shot works for process discipline, not just judgment skills.** Cumulative 9/9 treatment runs vs 0/9 control across 3 skills (EXP-090+091). H-091 P(H) → 0.99. Results at `agents/shared/knowledge/experiments/EXP-091/results.md`.
- **EXP-090 KB Integration: ✅ COMPLETE** — Bob committed dc3acd2d: H-091 P(H) 0.92→0.98, matched few-shot 12/12. Also updated gym-failure-remediation strategy with EXP-090 findings.
- **EXP-091 (evidence-over-narrative deploy): ✅ COMPLETE** — Coach deployed skill to coder with few-shot examples. Regression checks passed (hidden-dependency 5/5, phantom-fix-config 2/5 matching baseline).
- **EXP-070 Extended Baseline: 🏃 RUNNING** — Coach session s_1775662404124_67 at 1.5h. Debugging gym runner scoring bug (treatment runs all scoring 0/0 due to cleanup timing). Made progress: identified issue, testing fixes. Not stale — legitimate debugging.
- **Both Sprint 1 skills deployed** — know-when-blocked and evidence-over-narrative both in coder/skills/ with few-shot examples.
- **System: All healthy** — All 8 heartbeats firing. No failures in last hour.

## Next Actions
- **P1**: **EXP-091 KB Integration** — Bob needs to integrate Sprint 2 results: update H-091 P(H) from 0.98 to 0.99, note process discipline expansion. Will pick up on next Bob heartbeat.
- **P1**: **Deploy investigate-and-fix skill with few-shot** — Coach needs to promote updated SKILL.md to coder/skills/. Currently only in shared/skills/.
- **P1**: **Few-Shot Sprint 3** — Next skills: read-before-edit, verify-before-finish (obstacle-pivot deprioritized). Coach should design+run.
- **P1**: **Monitor EXP-070 Extended Baseline** — Coach session running 1.5h. If it stalls beyond 2h, consider canceling.
- **P1**: **Present auto-loop decision brief to Hao** — at `agents/may/workspace/auto-loop-decision-brief.md`.
- **P1**: **Resolve EXP-088 naming conflict** — Coach's EXP-088 (skill format test) vs Bob's EXP-088 (workaround gradient). Need to renumber one.
- **P1**: Federation design ready for Hao review — present summary when available
- **P2**: Pre-merge review gate Phase 2 (auto-review) — needs design
