# May's Supervisory Dashboard

Updated: 2026-04-08 ~14:13 UTC

## System Health
- **Amy-kimi**: 🔴 DOWN — 429 errors continue (billing/balance issue). Blocked on Hao.
- **Bob**: 🟢 Running — heartbeat cycle. EXP-087 integration complete (commit 7fc481e2).
- **Coach**: 🟢 Running — heartbeat cycle. Cross-reference skill deployed to coder (commit fe91729e).
- **All other agents**: 🟢 Heartbeats fired at 14:13, running normally. No errors in last hour.

## Active Priorities (from Hao)
1. Agents should be autonomous and proactive
2. Evidence-first rule for all changes
3. **Knowledge APPLICATION** — deploy verified KEs to production (Hao's directive)
4. Session digest system as unified recovery
5. Design docs before implementation

## What I'm Watching
| Issue | Status | Owner | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| EXP-083 Cross-Reference Generalization | ✅ COMPLETE | coach/bob | **MAJOR**: 100% treatment vs 0% baseline across 2 new domains (env-repair + schema-migration). Cross-reference skill generalizes perfectly. H-089 promoted to Tier 1 (P(H)=0.92). Bob integrated. |
| Federation Design (Local ↔ K3s) | ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE | bob | Bob produced 558-line design doc at `agents/shared/research-projects/federation-design.md`. Recommends Enhanced Git Federation (no new infra). 5-phase migration. Ready for Hao review. |
| EXP-085 Few-Shot Generalization | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **MAJOR**: 3/3 pass (100%) on escalation-judgment vs 12.5% baseline. Few-shot generalizes across judgment scenarios. H-091 promoted to Tier 1 (P(H)≥0.90). |
| KE-060 Intervention Taxonomy | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | Unified taxonomy: 3 mechanisms (M1: Analysis Activation, M2: Evidence Discovery, M3: Structural Constraint). Diagnostic decision tree. Written and verified. |
| EXP-086 Few-Shot Boundary Test | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **Mismatched 66.7% vs matched 100% vs baseline 12.5%**. Two-level transfer model: general principle transfers, specific procedure doesn't. H-091 updated. |
| EXP-086 Knowledge Integration | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | H-091 P(H) 0.88→0.90, two-level transfer model integrated, PRIORITY-TRACKER/INDEX updated. |
| EXP-087 Sycophants-Dilemma Few-Shot | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | **3/3 pass (100% vs 67% baseline)**. Matched few-shot closes last non-ceiling scenario. All judgment scenarios now have path to 100%. |
| EXP-087 Knowledge Integration | ✅ COMPLETE | bob | H-091 P(H) 0.90→0.92, matched few-shot 9/9 (100%) across 3 scenarios. Commit 7fc481e2. |
| Cross-Reference Skill Deployment | ✅ COMPLETE | coach | 71-line skill deployed to coder at `coder/skills/cross-reference-before-config-repair.md`. Commit fe91729e. |
| Auto-Loop Analysis | ✅ COMPLETE | tech-lead + bob | **Both converge**: zero engine changes needed. Decision brief written → `agents/may/workspace/auto-loop-decision-brief.md`. Ready for Hao. |
| Amy-kimi billing outage | 🔴 Blocked | Hao | Still 429, needs balance refill |
| Pre-merge review gate | ✅ Phase 1 done | - | Hook installed, needs Phase 2 (auto-review) |

## Completed/Archived
| Item | When | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| EXP-084 Skill Training Method Comparison | Apr 8 | **MAJOR**: Few-shot breaks the binary! 33% pass, avg 4.3/5 (+2.3). H-091 filed (P(H)=0.75). KE-059 created. Mechanism hierarchy L1→L5 established. |
| EXP-076 Workflow Audit | Apr 8 | Bob forking 5+ WORK sessions/6h (was 0/24h). Workflow adoption validated. |

## Latest Cycle Summary (14:13)
- **ALL ACTIVE ITEMS RESOLVED**: Zero running/pending items on the board. Everything is ✅ or blocked on Hao.
- **EXP-087 INTEGRATION COMPLETE**: Bob committed H-091 P(H) 0.90→0.92 (9/9 matched few-shot across 3 scenarios).
- **CROSS-REFERENCE SKILL DEPLOYED**: Coach deployed 71-line skill to coder (cross-reference-before-config-repair.md).
- **Research sprint complete**: EXP-083→087 all done. Few-shot (L3) is the validated intervention for judgment failures. H-091 at Tier 1 (P(H)=0.92).
- **System clean**: All heartbeats fired, no errors in last hour, no pending requests.

## Next Actions
- **P0**: **Present auto-loop decision brief to Hao** — Decision brief at `agents/may/workspace/auto-loop-decision-brief.md`. Need approval + implementation assignment.
- **P1**: **Plan few-shot skill conversion sprint** — H-091 confirmed (P(H)=0.92). Identify top text-rule skills to convert to matched few-shot format. Dispatch to Coach.
- **P1**: Federation design ready for Hao review — present summary when Hao is available
- **P2**: Bob analysis refresh (last was Apr 4, 4 days old) — lower priority since system is healthy
- **P2**: Scout C1.3 laggard intervention (76.3% vs 90%+ for others)
- **P2**: Pre-merge review gate Phase 2 (auto-review) — needs design
