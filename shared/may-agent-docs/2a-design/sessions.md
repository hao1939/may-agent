# Sessions

## The Model

Every agent interaction is a **session** — a single LLM conversation with tools.

Effective query schema. Some columns are added by migrations after the base
`CREATE TABLE`; agents should rely on the effective schema exposed by the SDK/query
surface, not hand-copy base DDL.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  sessionId       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  agent           TEXT NOT NULL,
  task            TEXT NOT NULL,
  status          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'running',  -- running | done | error | interrupted (idle is reserved but unused in practice)
  kind            TEXT,             -- chat | job | call
  source          TEXT,             -- what triggered it
  parentSessionId TEXT,             -- who spawned this session
  requestId       TEXT,
  workflowRunId   TEXT,
  projectId       TEXT,
  startedAt       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  endedAt         INTEGER,
  error           TEXT,             -- ⚠️ universally NULL due to db-writer race (KE-1558); use meta.json on disk for error text
  outcome         TEXT,
  opCount         INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  stepLabel       TEXT              -- migration-added workflow step label
);
```

## State Machine

```
created → running → idle      (reserved for chat sessions; currently unused)
                  → done      (completed job/call sessions)
                  → error
                  → interrupted
```

No "pending" or "queued" state. Sessions start running immediately when spawned.
Heartbeats are `call` sessions spawned by the heartbeat workflow via `ctx.runAgent()`. Query by `source LIKE '%heartbeat%'`, not by `kind`.

## Session Tree

```
Root (May heartbeat)
  ├── call("tech-lead", task)          ← child (blocks parent)
  │     └── call("dev", subtask)       ← grandchild
  └── fork("bob", task)                ← new root (async, returns immediately)
```

- **call** = synchronous, parent waits, child is linked via `parentSessionId`
- **fork** = asynchronous, returns sessionId, new session tree

## Persistence

Sessions persist to:
1. **SQLite** (`sessions` table) — for SQL queries, dashboard, status checks
2. **Disk** (`.state/sessions/<id>/meta.json`) — full metadata, messages

The DB is the queryable index. Disk is the source of truth for message history.

## Known Issues

### `error` column is always NULL (KE-1558)

The `sessions.error` column in SQLite is universally NULL — including for all
error sessions. A write-order race between `manager.ts` (writes errorText
correctly) and `db-writer.ts` (overwrites with NULL via `session.end` event,
which lacks the `error` field) causes the manager's value to be lost.
`updateSessionDb()` uses bare `error = ?` instead of `COALESCE(?, error)`.

**Workaround:** Read `.state/sessions/history/<id>/meta.json` on disk for the
actual error text. The `error` field in `meta.json` contains the correct value
(e.g., "Agent ended on an empty tool-use assistant turn").

**Fix pending:** Requires either adding `error` to the `session.end` bus event
data, or changing the UPDATE to use COALESCE. Both are `src/` changes requiring
Hao approval (ORDER-010).

## Implementation

- **Manager:** `src/lib/manager.ts` — spawns/manages sessions
- **DB writes:** `src/lib/db-writer.ts` and `src/lib/db/sessions.ts`
- **DB schema:** `src/lib/db/schema.ts`
- **Queries:** prefer `src/lib/query-service.ts` / SDK `query` over direct SQL in agent-facing code

## Design Decisions

### autoClose is internal

`autoClose` controls filesystem persistence (archive session dir to `history/` vs keep in-place).
It's an internal detail of the persistence layer, not a user-facing concept:
- Chat sessions use `autoClose: "never"` → dir stays in `sessions/` so they survive restarts
- Job/call sessions use `autoClose: "immediate"` → dir moves to `sessions/history/` on completion

Callers don't set it directly — it's derived from `kind`. Eventually, when we move to
pure-SQLite session tracking, `autoClose` disappears entirely.

### kind is metadata

`kind` ("chat" | "job" | "call") is a query/observability tag. It does not drive session
lifecycle — `autoClose` does that internally. The only behavioral branch on `kind`:
`chat-session.ts` finds the existing chat session by `kind === "chat"`.

Heartbeats are `call` kind sessions — the workflow system uses `ctx.runAgent()` which produces `call` sessions. There's no separate "heartbeat" kind.
