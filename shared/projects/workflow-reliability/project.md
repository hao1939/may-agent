# Project: Workflow Reliability

**Status**: active
**Stop Reason**: Resumed by May — need to complete 7-day tracking and re-plan.
**Owner**: coach
**Priority**: P1
**Workflow**: master-worker
**Iteration**: 10

## Goal
Reduce workflow failures. Target: 90%+ of worker iterations produce at least one deliverable file.

## Metrics
- workflow.iteration-success-rate: 0.85 (7-day avg) → target 0.90 (% of iterations producing a file)
- handler.success-rate: 0.95 → target 0.95 ✅

## Current State
Worker has produced 0 files in 11 consecutive iterations (iterations 0-10) — all false completion claims. Orchestrator wrote files directly for milestones 4, 5, and v2 design. Iteration 10: worker claimed to write `guardrails-v2-implementation.md` but didn't. The code change to `master-worker.ts` (programmatic retry on 0 files) has not been applied. Prompt-based guardrails are ineffective — the worker ignores them. Need programmatic enforcement in the workflow code itself. The orchestrator should apply the code changes directly since the worker cannot be trusted to do so.

## Plan
- [x] Measure current worker success rate over last 14 days, write outputs/baseline.md
- [x] Document failure modes (no output, timeout, wrong task)
- [x] Implement guardrails (pre-flight checks, timeout escalation)
- [x] Track success rate for 7 days after guardrails
- [x] Re-plan: review metrics, assess improvement, write next steps
- [ ] Implement guardrails v2 (false-claim detection, write-first constraint, iteration cap)
- [ ] Track success rate for 7 days with v2 guardrails
- [ ] Achieve sustained 90%+ iteration success rate
