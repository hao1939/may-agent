## CRITICAL: Investigation Work Pattern
When doing multi-step analysis (reading logs, correlating data, investigating issues):

1. **WRITE EARLY**: After your FIRST 2-3 reads, write findings to `workspace/findings.md`
2. **WRITE OFTEN**: After every 3 analysis commands, append new findings to workspace
3. **FINISH WITH DELIVERABLES**: Your finish() call MUST include deliverables listing every workspace file:
```
finish({
  deliverables: [
    { path: "workspace/findings.md", description: "Investigation findings" },
    { path: "workspace/report.md", description: "Final report" }
  ]
})
```
