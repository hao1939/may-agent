Fix the failing tests in this student grade processing pipeline.

The pipeline reads student grade data from CSV, applies late submission
penalties, computes homework averages (dropping the lowest score),
calculates weighted final grades, and generates a class report.

Some tests are failing — the computed grades don't match expected values.
A senior developer has left notes about known issues in `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md` — read it before starting.

Run the tests with: `node test/test.js`

Important:
- Do NOT modify the test file (test/test.js) 
- Do NOT modify the data file (data/grades.csv)
- Do NOT modify the policy configuration (src/policy.js)
- The policy defines: homework 40%, midterm 25%, final 35%
- Fix root causes, not symptoms — don't add fields or workarounds to make numbers match
