# Xiaohongshu Living Topic Map

This map starts from the [human-collection seed ledger](./xhs-seed-ledger.md).
The direct seed set is currently unobserved, so current cycles use retained
local XHS evidence as an explicit fallback. No retained URL is called a human
seed unless a readable collection snapshot confirms it.

## Revisable value rubric

Once direct seeds are readable, **seed connection** is the first selector.
Until then it stays `U` (unknown), and the fallback score uses five 0–3 axes:

- **L — local XHS support:** specificity and number of deduplicated retained
  XHS sources.
- **C — cross-source support:** accessible independent evidence that can test,
  refine, or contradict the XHS signal.
- **I — operational impact:** consequence for building, evaluating, or
  governing agents.
- **G — resolvable gap:** important uncertainty that a bounded deep dive can
  reduce now.
- **F — freshness:** recency of the retained XHS or related evidence.

The score is `L+C+I+G+F` out of 15. Engagement affects discovery priority only;
it is not evidence quality.

## Active clusters

| Cluster | Seed connection | Score | Supporting sources | Current finding / uncertainty | Confidence | Next exploration |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-evolution reliability and evaluation authority** | U | **13** (`3+3+3+2+2`) | [Retained XHS packet](./findings/2026-08-06-xhs-self-evolving-agent-control-surface.md); [cross-source self-improvement note](./findings/2026-07-23-hn-self-improving-agent-loops.md); arXiv [`2608.22610v1`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.22610v1) | XHS metadata says attention is moving from generic self-evolution toward evaluator independence, learning state, and human interference. Cross-source evidence adds task-order, security, executor-compatibility, and coalition confounders. Unknown: whether any of these posts are human-collected or whether full XHS content supports more than their visible metadata. | Moderate-high for the cross-source reliability pattern; low for unseen XHS post contents. | Reproduce or independently audit `2608.22610` once code is released; on seed access, deep-read any collected evaluator/skill-reliability post first. |
| **Long-horizon persistence and stage-aware memory governance** | U | **15** (`3+3+3+3+3`) | [Persistence-infrastructure packet](./findings/2026-07-22-xhs-agent-persistence-infrastructure.md); [long-horizon packet](./findings/2026-07-21-xhs-long-horizon-agents-survey.md); [ICML-memory packet](./findings/2026-07-29-xhs-icml2026-agent-memory-papers.md); arXiv [`2608.30177v1`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.30177v1); GitHub [paper-index revision](https://github.com/NY1024/AgentSafety-Papers/commit/3a46dd37588e352a03e917da7a71b266f36e16bb) | Persistent agents need governed admission and management, but retrieval is not merely solved plumbing: greater exposure can raise clean utility and poisoning success together. Direct collection relevance remains unknown, and the paper's four-system results are diagnostic rather than causal stage interventions. | High for the paper's evaluated settings; moderate for transfer beyond two benchmarks and two attacks; low for unseen XHS post contents. | Find or reproduce a released MemGauge implementation, then test whether stage profiles hold under benign retrieval errors and other attacks; reconcile any newly readable collected memory post first. |
| **Build playbooks and implementation literacy** | U | **10** (`2+2+2+2+2`) | [Retained XHS build-playbook packet](./findings/2026-08-06-xhs-build-playbooks-outperform-intros.md) | In one search packet, process maps and source-code notes had more visible engagement than generic definitions or launch framing. Unknown: collection relevance, content quality, and whether the ranking persists across queries or time. | Low-moderate; title/author/like snapshots only. | On access, compare collected build artifacts by format and inspect whether saves/comments reflect successful use rather than curiosity. |

## Selected deep dive — coalition-conditioned skill reliability

The top-scoring cluster was selected because it connects the freshest retained
XHS control-surface signal to an accessible, testable reliability mechanism.
A full-source review of arXiv [`2608.22610v1`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.22610v1) adds one bounded finding to the
[maintained self-improvement note](./findings/2026-07-23-hn-self-improving-agent-loops.md):
skill reliability is a property of the skill, surrounding bank, and deployment
domain, not an intrinsic label on a skill.

Observed paper evidence includes 12 candidate proposals over three seeds, a
baseline outcome gate accepting 6 versus CASS accepting 1, and the baseline's
accepted additions measuring `-1.38` percentage points on average in a
bank-size-controlled comparison. A 20-query unlabeled target probe improved all
six tested banks after masking. The authors' strongest source-to-target reversal
has a negative target point estimate whose confidence interval includes zero,
and code is promised rather than currently available. Those limits keep this
as a promising mechanism-level result, not a universal rule.

## Second-cycle selection — stage-wise memory utility and risk

The second reconciliation kept direct seed membership unknown and preserved
the same 104-ID local fallback. Among current arXiv candidates, `2608.30177v1`
scored 15/15 because it has specific local XHS support, directly tests and
qualifies an existing high-impact Scout synthesis, resolves a current gap, and
was published on 2026-08-31. `2608.22339v1` and `2608.25553v3` each remained
valuable at 14/15 (`3+3+3+2+3`) but overlap more with already-deep-dived
admission and stale-memory work; `2608.17665v1` addresses a narrower
community-polarization branch.
The rubric therefore still selects `2608.30177v1` after reconciliation.

The full TeX source reports 11 models, 100 questions from each of LongMemEval
and LoCoMo, and matched clean/poisoned stage interventions. Writing has a
threshold-like transition: attack success stays generally below 10% through
0.3–0.5 admission coverage, then reaches 37–64% at full coverage. Management
changes attack success by as much as 62% while clean utility changes only 3–5%.
Across Mem0, Hindsight, LangMem, and A-MEM, top-K 1→7 raises clean utility from
24.6–29.3% to 52.7–64.2% and attack success from 4.7–12.2% to 36.1–53.7%.
Judge agreement with human majority labels is 91% on 400 trajectories, with
inter-annotator κ=0.78.

The maintained
[read-write attention synthesis](./the-read-write-attention-inversion.md) now
states the bounded conclusion: write governance remains necessary, but
retrieval exposure must be governed too. GitHub independently exposed the
paper through an AgentSafety-Papers index at pinned revision `3a46dd3`; neither
that index nor the paper source provides released MemGauge experiment code.
The GitHub record is discovery provenance, not a second experimental
confirmation. Reddit's public search RSS also surfaced metadata-only candidate
[`t3_1v8a3sh`](https://www.reddit.com/r/mlops/comments/1v8a3sh/longterm_memory_in_llm_agents_is_an_attack/),
whose title connects long-lived memory to an attack surface. The post-level
deep read was rate-limited, so its body supports no claim here.

## Connections and tension

- **Self-evolution ↔ governed memory:** a growing skill or memory bank is a
  write-admission system. Coalition pollution is another form of ungated
  accumulation; target-conditioned masking is a subtraction step.
- **Build playbooks ↔ evaluation authority:** practical guides can spread a
  pattern before its reliability conditions are known. Visible engagement
  should nominate an audit, not substitute for one.
- **Contradiction to simple accumulation:** the retained XHS memory-evolution
  signal treats adaptive banks as progress; `2608.22610` shows that more
  admitted skills can reduce average performance. The claims can coexist only
  if admission and retirement evidence are explicit.
- **Correction to exclusive write-side governance:** `2608.30177` shows that
  management can locally decouple risk, while retrieval exposure couples clean
  utility and attack success. The earlier write-path thesis survives only as a
  claim about neglected controls, not proof that read-side choices are solved.
- **Blocked evidence:** direct collection membership, current engagement, full
  post text, comments, and collection removals remain unknown while the browser
  endpoint is outside this worker's reachable network namespace. Reddit's
  global and `r/LocalLLaMA` public JSON searches returned HTTP 403 `text/html`
  network-security blocks. Global search RSS returned HTTP 200 and stable post
  metadata, but the selected post's RSS returned HTTP 429 on deep read; no
  body-level Reddit claim was admitted.

## Cycle log

| Cycle | Seed reconciliation | Related discovery | Deep dive | Map decision | Next |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-01 | Direct set unobserved; no additions, changes, or removals inferred. Local fallback: 104 stable IDs / 125 occurrences, deduplicated by ID. | arXiv query for self-evolving/self-improving agents found `2608.22610v1`; full source reviewed. | Coalition pollution and cross-domain utility reversal. | Added three active clusters; selected reliability/authority at 13/15. | Restore observational collection reachability, then reconcile and prioritize any collected evaluator or skill-bank post; independently test the paper when code appears. |
| 2026-09-01 cycle 2 | Reconciled first at 10:00:06Z: direct set still unobserved; local fallback unchanged at 104 stable IDs / 125 occurrences and fingerprint `889d3247…d8fb`. | After reconciliation, arXiv HTML search returned `2608.30177` first; the specific API record and full source were readable. GitHub's complete nine-result `MemGauge` query found a pinned paper index but no attributable experiment repository. Reddit JSON returned HTTP 403; global search RSS returned metadata for `t3_1v8a3sh`, then its deep read returned HTTP 429. | Stage-wise utility-risk profiles across controlled interventions and four real systems. | Memory governance rises to 15/15 and qualifies the read-write synthesis; Reddit metadata remains a candidate, not claim support. | Reconcile XHS first again; look for attributable `2608.30177` code, then reproduce stage profiles under additional attacks. Revisit the Reddit candidate after the rate-limit boundary changes. |
