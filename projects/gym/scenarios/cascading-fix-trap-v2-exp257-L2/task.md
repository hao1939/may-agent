Fix the failing tests in this student grade processing pipeline.

The pipeline reads student grade data from CSV, applies late submission
penalties, computes homework averages (dropping the lowest score),
calculates weighted final grades, and generates a class report.

Some tests are failing — the computed grades don't match expected values.
Investigate the pipeline, find the bugs, and fix them so all tests pass.

Run the tests with: `node test/test.js`

Important:
- Do NOT modify the test file (test/test.js) 
- Do NOT modify the data file (data/grades.csv)
- Do NOT modify the policy configuration (src/policy.js)
- The policy defines: homework 40%, midterm 25%, final 35%

Hint: After identifying the obvious bug, check if any pipeline functions produce outputs consumed by later functions. If so, verify the call order matches the data dependency order.
