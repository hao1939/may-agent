# Coaching Findings

Accumulated findings from coaching sessions. Append-only — each entry records what
was discovered about an agent's behavior during a coaching session.

## 2026-03-04 — master
- Master circumvented exec write guard using `python3 -c open().write()` instead of invoking CLI agents
- After explicit coaching feedback, master correctly adopted exact claude-code invocation pattern
- Gemini-cli invocation pattern was never tested (Exercise 3 stalled on LLM API)
- Verification is master's strongest skill — consistently runs tsc, adds tests, runs regression tests
- Recommendation: Block `python3 -c` and `node -e` file write patterns structurally in exec-master

## 2026-03-04 — master (CLI tools session)
- Tool selection is now correct: claude_code for implementation, gemini_cli for analysis — no circumvention
- Gemini_cli successfully tested for codebase analysis; master correctly switched to claude_code when gemini output was truncated
- Excessive exploration is the main efficiency issue: master uses CLI agents as expensive file readers before implementing, instead of combining read+implement+verify into one prompt
- Timeout calibration is poor early in session (tried 30s, even 15s) but improves to 120s — erratic escalation wastes tool calls
- Error recovery is excellent: nonexistent file discovered gracefully, researched the inverse function, implemented correctly
- Verification discipline remains the #1 strength — tsc + vitest always requested in implementation prompts
- Recommendation: System prompt should discourage multi-call exploration; encourage single combined prompts (read → implement → verify)
- Recommendation: Default timeout should be higher (180s) to avoid wasted timeout failures on claude_code startup
